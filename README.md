# bank-app


## **Description**
I used this project to train myself on **Spring Security architecture**, focusing on the key packages, interfaces, and classes that handle authentication and authorization in web applications. It also covers essential security topics such as **CORS, CSRF, JWT, OAuth2, password management, method-level security**, and managing **users, roles, and authorities**.

## **Features**
- **Authentication & Authorization** – Manage and control access within your application.
- **Security Features** – Includes **CORS, CSRF protection**, and **JWT** for stateless authentication.
- **OAuth2 Integration** – Support for **social login** and other OAuth2-based authentications.
- **Method-Level Security** – Secure specific methods using annotations like `@Secured` and `@PreAuthorize`.
- **User & Role Management** – Comprehensive tools for managing **users, roles, and authorities**.

## **Getting Started**
### **Prerequisites**
- Java 17+
- Spring Boot 3+
- Maven
- PostgreSQL/MySQL (for user management)
